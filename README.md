# Life Expectancy Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Life Expectancy Dashboard designed to analyze global health, demographic, and socio-economic indicators across countries and years. The dashboard provides a clear view of how factors such as population size, alcohol consumption, education, income composition, disease trends, and mortality rates relate to life expectancy outcomes worldwide.

The analysis is built to support data-driven insights for public health research, policy evaluation, and academic assessment.



# Key Insights Covered

## 🌍 Country Coverage
A total of 193 countries are included in the analysis, providing a comprehensive global overview.


## 🍺 Alcohol Consumption by Country

Displays countries with the highest recorded alcohol consumption

Helps identify behavioral factors linked to health outcomes

## 👥 Population Distribution

Displays total population by country, with emphasis on highly populated nations.

Helps contextualize health outcomes relative to population size.


## 🎓 Education & Income Composition

Shows the sum of schooling years and income composition of resources, categorized by development status.

Clearly distinguishes trends between developed and developing countries.


## ❤ Life Expectancy & Health Expenditure

Presents average life expectancy by country.
Connects life expectancy outcomes with percentage health expenditure, supporting comparative health investment analysis.


## 🦠 Disease Trends & Mortality

Visualizes total disease trends, including:
•	Child mortality

•	Adult mortality

Trends are analyzed to identify patterns, spikes, and long-term changes in mortality outcomes.
This section helps reveal how preventable diseases and mortality rates influence overall life expectancy, especially when compared between developed and developing nations.



## 📊 Analytical Focus

The dashboard enables users to:
Compare life expectancy trends across countries and years
Examine how socio-economic factors (education, income, health spending) affect longevity
Identify countries with high mortality burdens and lower life expectancy
Understand the relationship between population size and health outcomes
Support evidence-based discussions in public health and development studies



## 🛠 Tools & Methodology
Data Processing: Cleaned and structured for consistency across years and countries
Analysis: Aggregations, averages, and trend analysis
Visualization Tool: Power BI
Key Dimensions: Country, Year, Development Status
Key Measures: Life Expectancy, Mortality Rates, Population, Alcohol Consumption, Schooling, Income Composition



## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary goal of this dashboard is to transform complex global health data into clear, interactive, and actionable insights. It is designed for:
Academic research and coursework
Public health analysis
Policy evaluation and comparison
Data visualization portfolio presentation



## 📌 Conclusion

The Life Expectancy Dashboard provides a holistic view of global health disparities by linking life expectancy with demographic, socio-economic, and health indicators. By exploring these relationships visually, users can better understand the factors that drive longevity and identify areas requiring targeted health interventions.
